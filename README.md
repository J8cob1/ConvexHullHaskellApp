# ConvexHullHaskellApp

This application, developed as a part of a course at Portland State University, with continued development in a second, allows you to run Convex Hull Algorithms on various datasets. 

## Running
stack install
stack run

## Current Features
- Allows you to run three algorithms on convex hull datasets via a terminal user interface
- Allows you to enter and randomly generate your own custom datasets using some parameters that you can specify
- Draws basic graphs of the resulting convex hulls
