-- Convex Hull Algorithms take a set of points in some dimension and return a set such that the hull around the such that the rest of the points in the input set are contained within it 
-- We will be working with several algorithms, including:
--  - Optimal Algorithms
--    * Chan's Algorithm
--    * Divide and COnquer
--  - Graham's Scan
--  - Jarvis March
--  etc
-- 

-- For easier referencing
type Point2D = (Int, Int)
